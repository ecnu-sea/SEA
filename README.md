## üî• News
- *2024.06*: üéâ We have made SEA series [models](https://huggingface.co/ECNU-SEA) and [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ECNU-SEA/SEA_data) public !

## ‚ùì What is SEA 

SEA is a novel framework for automated paper reviewing based on three modules: Standardization, Evaluation, and Analysis. SEA is capable of generating comprehensive and high-quality review feedback with high consistency for papers, thereby assisting researchers in improving the quality of their work.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart
1. **Clone the GitHub Repository:** 

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/ecnu-sea/SEA.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment:** 

   ```shell
   conda create -n sea python=3.10 -y
   conda activate sea
   ```

3. **Install SEA Dependencies:** 
   ```shell
   cd SEA
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
4. **Download SEA-E model:**
   
   You can download the [SEA-E](https://huggingface.co/ECNU-SEA/SEA-E) model from Hugging Face to a local path by yourself, or you can run the following download script code:
   ```shell
   python web_ui/download_model.py
   ```

6. **Now you are ready to have fun:**

   Note that you can change the hyper parameters in run_webui.sh.
   ```shell
   cd web_ui
   bash run_webui.sh
   ```
   **_Tips: You can set the model path downloaded from Hugging Face in the web_ui/run_webui.sh file._**
   

## üõ° Disclaimer

It must be underscored that the primary objective of SEA is to provide informative reviews for authors to **furnish authors with insightful critiques** aimed at **refining their works**, rather than directly influencing decisions regarding the acceptance or rejection of the papers. **Commercial use is not allowed.**, and we have emphasized this point in the supplementary clauses of the model's license.
