## üî• News
- *2024.06*: üéâ We have made SEA series [models](https://huggingface.co/ECNU-SEA) public !

## ‚ùì What is SEA 

SEA is a novel framework for automated paper reviewing based on three modules: Standardization, Evaluation, and Analysis. SEA is capable of generating comprehensive and high-quality review feedback with high consistency for papers.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart



## üõ° Disclaimer

It must be underscored that the primary objective of SEA is to provide informative reviews for authors to **furnish authors with insightful critiques** aimed at **refining their works**, rather than directly influencing decisions regarding the acceptance or rejection of the papers. Commercial use is not allowed. We have also emphasized this point in the supplementary clauses of the model's license.
